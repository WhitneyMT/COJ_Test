<h1>City of Johannesburg Tourism Website</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

The City of Johannesburg (CoJ) Tourism previously appointed an external service provider to provide the following services:

  - Develop and implement the website and the mobile application.
  - Update the content of the website.
  - Allow listing by different service providers.
    
The service providerâ€™s contract expired before the service provider could complete all the milestones. At this point, only the development work was concluded. A decision was taken by CoJ to host the application at the CoJ Data Centre located at its premises but this was partially completed. The application was handed over to CoJ Group Information and Communication Technology (GICT)

The CoJ Tourism website was fully developed but the User Application Testing (UAT) had not been conducted. The technical team could not ascertain what level of effort will be required to resolve any misalignment on the system/application. There was a great risk for scope increase.

After further analysis, supported by the feasibility study conducted, it was determined that what had been developed by the previous service provider could not be implemented, and the code was inaccessible. This necessitated recoding all the pages, effectively turning the project into a resuscitation.
